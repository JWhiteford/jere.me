          <h2>Dazzle</h2>
          <p>Website design &#38; development for a local "Event Decorating" company.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cd-project-info">
          <p>This project is currently in the design stage but I'm pretty happy with what I've created so far. Typically our clients are in the oil and gas related; so its rare I get a chance to work on a project that's softer looking.</p>
          <p>So far this has been fun to plan and design as I get to spend more time on typography and add subtle layering to the design.</p>
          <p>An important part of this design is that I've been focused on keeping the site fast and fully responsive. The background is composed of css gradients and a single tiny svg; instead of a monstrous image.</p>
          <p><img src="../img/dazzle.jpg" alt="wedding decor web design" class="img-res"></p>
          <p>Once I've completed the site I will add a link.</p>

        <h2>jere.me</h2>
        <p>Business card design</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cd-project-info">
        <p>Most of my day-to-day work is spent in a code editor, interacting with clients or occasionally getting to come up with website designs. Its rare that I'll attempt to create a logo or do any print design.</p>
        <p>These are my personal business cards. They are "me" and I am happy with how they turned out.</p>

      <div class="cd-title">
        <h2>Best of bad SEO</h2>
        <p>Super fast, light-weight landing page</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cd-project-info">
        <p>The collective at Google is much more intelligent than I; so I don't see a point in trying to trick them. Instead I'd rather abide to their guidelines and create simple, fast websites that users will hopefully find useful.</p>
        <p>Although this site wasn't my choice I still wanted to improve on what it was.</p>
        <p>Originally it was a true doorway page leading with a "mere 23" links to a single different website. Along with the numerous links it was exceedingly keyword stuffed (the single page had 46 references to "Edmonton web design") and very painful to read.</p>
        <p>While I wasn't a big fan of the doorway site I was able to convert it into a landing page with a little bit of value.</p>
        <p>My goal with this site was to make it fast and easy to read.</p>
