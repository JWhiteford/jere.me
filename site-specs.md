<h1>About <span>this site</span></h1>
There were many things to consider when I decided to build this site. My requirements were simple. It needed to be easy to update, fast, mobile friendly and clean.

I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as the static site generator, sass as my preprocessor and various tools to complete the project. To see a more in-depth list of what was used to create this site check out the humans.txt file.
