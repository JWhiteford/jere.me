<h1>About <span>this site</span></h1>
There were many things to consider when I decided to build this site. My requirements were simple. It needed to be easy to update, fast, mobile friendly and clean.

I used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> as the static site generator, Sass (with a little bit of flavor from compass &#38; Susy) as my preprocessor and various tools to complete the project.
